# SMART-DISPOSAL-MACHINE
‚ôªÔ∏è Abstract ‚Äì Smart Disposal Machine (Green Guardian)
The Smart Disposal Machine (SDM), codenamed Green Guardian, is an AI- and IoT-enabled automated waste management system designed to enhance hygiene, optimize waste collection, and support sustainable living. Developed at IIT Guwahati, SDM integrates real-time monitoring, AI-powered waste classification, and automated compression and segregation mechanisms to address key challenges in conventional waste disposal systems.

Key features include:

ü§ñ AI-Based Waste Segregation using Gemini 1.5 for classification into biodegradable, recyclable, and non-recyclable categories.

üì¶ Lead Screw Compression Mechanism for optimized space utilization.

üì° IoT Integration with ultrasonic sensors and a Streamlit dashboard for live fill-level tracking and smart notifications.

üßº Contactless Hygiene System enabled by IR sensors and servo-controlled lids.

üó∫Ô∏è Web-Based Dashboard showing real-time bin status and geolocation for efficient waste collection.

By combining mechanical automation, embedded systems (Raspberry Pi + Arduino), and AI models, the SDM offers a scalable and cost-effective solution to urban waste management. This repository contains the system's source code, mechanical and electronic schematics, and documentation for deployment and further development.
